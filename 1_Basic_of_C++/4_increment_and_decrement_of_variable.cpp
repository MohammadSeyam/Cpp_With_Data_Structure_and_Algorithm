/*
Other ways of increment and decrement 

# x -= 2 -> x will be decrease by 2 
# x += 2 -> x will be increase by 2
# x /=2  -> x will be devide by 2
# x *=2  -> x will be multiply by 2

# x++ -> x will be increase by 1 ,, post increment 
# ++x -> x will be increase by 1 ,, pre increment
# same goes for decrement
